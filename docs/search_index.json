R studio allows for working in many different file types. For this workshop, we will be using R Markdown files. They have a .Rmd file extension. In this current file, you will find two types of areas. This current area is for markdown text. Code will not be executed here and you can use markdown formatting such as bold and italics. I encourage you to take advantage of this space to take notes throughout the lessons, feel free to add/edit any of the text in this document! Markdown text will not affect how the code is run. The second area will is call code chucks such as the one immediately below this. Code chunks always start with three ``` followed by the name of the language you are using in the chunk. You can press the green play button in the top right corner within each chunk or the run the cell. Edit x &lt;- 123 x ## [1] 123 y = 2 y ## [1] 2 The put arrow is used to assign value in objects. While a single equal sign can work as well, it is not good coding practice for R and should be saved for specifying parameters within functions (we’ll get back to this) Some common keyboard shortcuts that may be useful: cntl/cmd + alt + i - insert a new code cell (or press the green c with a + in the console toolbar) cntl/cmd + enter - run only the line your cursor is on cntl/cmd + shift + enter - run all lines in the cell (or press the green play button) Feel free to try editing the code above, perhaps by multiply the value of x by 2. Within code cells, you can also add comments by starting a line with a hashtag # to indicate lines you do not want to run. I will use this often for guidance or instructions, this is another great way to take notes throughout the workshop Follow the instructions to write your first script! math can only be done on numerics # Save the value of 12 to an object called &quot;dozen&quot; dozen &lt;- 12 #dozen # Use this object to calculate how many eggs are in 14 dozen eggs dozen*14 ## [1] 168 General Syntax Multiple values can be stored into an object using the function c() for combine or concatenate prime &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 7) prime ## [1] 1 3 5 7 Functions act on objects and can have additional parameters within the round brackets to specify how the command is carried out prime_mean &lt;- mean(prime) prime_mean ## [1] 4 All functions have default parameters that you can access using the help panel (same area as the “Files” and “Plots” panel) or using a ? before the function name ?mean Getting Started with Data Data can be created de novo from within R or read in from an external object. Either way, there are a few broad categories of data types that you will encounter: Vectors - 1 dimensional, for example the string of numbers in our prime object Data frames - 2 dimensional, for example a table with rows of patients and columns for clinical characteristics Lists - complex 1 dimensional, can store data of different types within a single object Vectors can only hold one type of data within a single object # Numeric first5 &lt;- c(1:5) first5 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 # Character fruits &lt;- c(&#39;orange&#39;, &quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;grapefruit&quot;, &quot;starfruit&quot;) fruits ## [1] &quot;orange&quot; &quot;apple&quot; &quot;banana&quot; &quot;grapefruit&quot; &quot;starfruit&quot; # Logical evaluate &lt;- 64 == 46 evaluate ## [1] FALSE 1 dimensional vectors can be used by themselves or used as the foundation for creating data frames firstDF &lt;- data.frame(first5, fruits) firstDF ## first5 fruits ## 1 1 orange ## 2 2 apple ## 3 3 banana ## 4 4 grapefruit ## 5 5 starfruit class(firstDF) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; colnames(firstDF) ## [1] &quot;first5&quot; &quot;fruits&quot; rownames(firstDF) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; dim(firstDF) # ALWAYS rows then columns ## [1] 5 2 Dataframes are the most common way of storing information. One of their major strengths is that you can access piece of information independently. Square brackets [] are used to access data within an object, always in the format of [rows,columns]. If you want to grab a specific row but all the columns of that row, you can leave the column specifier blank - but you always need the comma there regardless. prime[2] ## [1] 3 firstDF [2, 4] # [rows,col] ## NULL Importing Data Rather than entering you data manually, you are more likely to read in data from an external source such as an output file from a machine or data stored in an excel table. R is pretty flexible with the files that it can accept, but there are differences to how it is read in. The recommended format is a .csv file. This stands for “comma separated values”. This means columns are separated by commas and rows are separated by hard enters. In this module, we will be working with an dataset measuring categorical and integral characteristics of abalone gathered in Australia Source: Data comes from an original (non-machine-learning) study: Warwick J Nash, Tracy L Sellers, Simon R Talbot, Andrew J Cawthorn and Wes B Ford (1994) “The Population Biology of Abalone (Haliotis species) in Tasmania. I. Blacklip Abalone (H. rubra) from the North Coast and Islands of Bass Strait”, Sea Fisheries Division, Technical Report No. 48 (ISSN 1034-3288) https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone Data Set Information: Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope – a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem. Attribute Information: Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification problem. Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description Sex / nominal / – / M, F, and I (infant) Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding) Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried Rings / integer / – / +1.5 gives the age in years As this is a csv file, we will be using the aptly named function “read.csv()” to import the file into R. Make sure your abalone.csv file is in the same directory/folder as your .Rmd file. The first parameter the read.csv() function requires is the path to the file. This will just be the file name since they are both within the same folder. If the dataset your working with is not in the same folder, you can modify the path to navigate through your directories to locate the file or use the Import Dataset button. Notice when we open the abalone dataset that the first row holds the column names rather than the first set of observations. We will need to let R know that there is a header in the parameters of the read.csv() function. #abalone &lt;- read.csv(&quot;anotherfolder//abalone.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) #abalone &lt;- read.csv(&quot;C:/Users/Frances/Downloads/BioinformaticsWorkshop_INR_June2024-20240611T023701Z-001/BioinformaticsWorkshop_INR_June2024/abalone.csv&quot;) abalone &lt;- read.csv(&quot;../INR-2024/datasets/abalone.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) # abalone - commented out since is a big file It is almost never useful to print out the whole table because humans are not good at inspecting numbers.

Let’s take a look at the data in this column closer The sting $ operator is used to access a column within a dataframe. head(abalone$Sex, n=20) # object$columnName ## [1] &quot;M&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;M&quot; ## [20] &quot;M&quot; class(abalone$Sex) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; abalone$Sex &lt;- as.character(abalone$Sex) As a column of character values, the relationship between the observations being recorded as “M”, “F’, or”I” are not being recognized. We will need convert this column to factor. head(as.factor(abalone$Sex)) ## [1] M M F M I I ## Levels: F I M summary(as.factor(abalone$Sex)) ## F I M ## 1307 1342 1528 Now that we understand factors, let’s overwrite the column in the original dataset. Remember, there is no undo button in programming. Double check your work before you overwrite objects abalone$Sex &lt;- as.factor(abalone$Sex) head(abalone) ## Sex Length Diameter Height Whole.weight Shucked.weight Viscera.weight ## 1 M 0.455 0.365 0.095 0.5140 0.2245 0.1010 ## 2 M 0.350 0.265 0.090 0.2255 0.0995 0.0485 ## 3 F 0.530 0.420 0.135 0.6770 0.2565 0.1415 ## 4 M 0.440 0.365 0.125 0.5160 0.2155 0.1140 ## 5 I 0.330 0.255 0.080 0.2050 0.0895 0.0395 ## 6 I 0.425 0.300 0.095 0.3515 0.1410 0.0775 ## Shell.weight Rings ## 1 0.150 15 ## 2 0.070 7 ## 3 0.210 9 ## 4 0.155 10 ## 5 0.055 7 ## 6 0.120 8 Exercise 1 (10 mins) Explore the abalone dataset. A. Determine the sex of abalone (col) number 65, 85, and 99 (rows) B. Out of these three abalone, determine which of the three oysters is largest diameter C. Use the “mean()” function to determine the mean abalone diameter overall (not just the three) Remember: error messages are normal and part of the troubleshooting process. This is R’s way of communicating where to double check - not an indication of your ability to code! You’re doing great! Take down your green stickies at the start of this activity and put them up when you’re done and ready to re-group! # Hints to get you started: # Square brackets are used to access position: object[row,columns] # The function c() for combine or concatenate is needed when there are multiple inputs # Numeric values should not be enclosed in quotations, but character values require quotations. abalone$Diameter[c(65, 85, 99)] ## [1] 0.40 0.45 0.37 colnames(abalone) ## [1] &quot;Sex&quot; &quot;Length&quot; &quot;Diameter&quot; &quot;Height&quot; ## [5] &quot;Whole.weight&quot; &quot;Shucked.weight&quot; &quot;Viscera.weight&quot; &quot;Shell.weight&quot; ## [9] &quot;Rings&quot; abalone[c(65, 85, 99), 3] #&quot;Diameter&quot;] ## [1] 0.40 0.45 0.37 abalone_diameter &lt;- abalone[c(65, 85, 99), 3] abalone_diameter ## [1] 0.40 0.45 0.37 mean(abalone$Diameter) ## [1] 0.4078813 Good job writing your first investigative pieces of code! Woo hoo! Revising the R Environment Let’s take a moment to revisit the Rstudio interface and the environment panel. We’ve worked with a few objects at this point. The environment panel can give us an overview of the objects in the environment and allow us to preview dataframes. If you would like to remove any objects, perhaps you made two objects that are very close in spelling and want to remove the incorrect object, you can use the function rm() for remove. Again, this is an irreversible action - double check your work. If you’ve documented your code properly, you can always re-read in the object in case you mistakenly deleted anything you wanted to keep. #ABalone &lt;- &quot;blank&quot; #rm(ABalone) The “object not found” error is a common one. In case you get this, you can refer to this environment tab to double check if it exists. Some common reasons this error message is triggered include: Typo mistakes (ex. firstDf vs firstDF) Empty environment (ex. object need to be created everytime you open the document. If you save and close RStudio, the text in the .Rmd file will be preserved but not the virtual objects in the environment.) As an overview of our environment, we can also use the sessionInfo() command. This is a good practice to have at the end of your code to document which packages you used and what version they were. sessionInfo() ## R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31) ## Platform: aarch64-apple-darwin20 ## Running under: macOS Sequoia 15.6 ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib ## LAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib; LAPACK version 3.12.0 ## ## locale: ## [1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 ## ## time zone: America/Toronto ## tzcode source: internal ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] digest_0.6.37 R6_2.6.1 bookdown_0.43 fastmap_1.2.0 ## [5] xfun_0.52 cachem_1.1.0 knitr_1.50 htmltools_0.5.8.1 ## [9] rmarkdown_2.29 lifecycle_1.0.4 cli_3.6.5 sass_0.4.10 ## [13] jquerylib_0.1.4 compiler_4.4.2 rstudioapi_0.17.1 tools_4.4.2 ## [17] evaluate_1.0.4 bslib_0.9.0 yaml_2.3.10 jsonlite_2.0.0 ## [21] rlang_1.1.6 Notice that we have some base packages active even though we did not explicitly call for them. Installing Packages from CRAN Before we move on to a break, let’s revisit functions and packages. Functions are the commands we use to act on objects. As an open source software, anyone can develop new functions and package them into … packages to share with the community! Virtually anything you want to do - so does someone else! Referring back to my introduction presentation, R includes many pre-installed functions like c() and summary() that we’ve been using. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. We’ll be exploring a package called tidyverse developed to wrangle and reshape data. We will need to install this package only the first time we’re using it, similar to how we need to download a new app to our phones or computers before using it. Every time we want to use it, we still need to open it. Most general use packages are hosted on the CRAN network. Another package repository you will encounter specifically for biological applications is called Bioconductor (we won’t be using this for now). To download and install a package from CRAN, we will use another aptly named packaged called install.packages() Since R has not encountered the package before, we will need to use brackets around the name of the package we want to install #install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ── ## ✔ dplyr 1.1.4 ✔ readr 2.1.5 ## ✔ forcats 1.0.0 ✔ stringr 1.5.1 ## ✔ ggplot2 3.5.2 ✔ tibble 3.3.0 ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.4 ✔ tidyr 1.3.1 ## ✔ purrr 1.0.4 ## ── Conflicts ──────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ── ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## ✖ dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors Once you have it installed, you can “open” them. You need to activate the library every new session of R. You will likely see some warning messages – warnings are not error messages. - Error messages mean that R could not do what you asked it to and tries to explain the problem - Warning messages mean that R did what it think you wanted to do but wants to caution you to double check some parameters In this case, the “Attaching packages” indicates the tidyverse package in opening other accompanying packages as well that it needs to function. “Conflicts” indicate that there are separate packages with functions of the same name and which one takes priority. To access a function from a specific package, you can use the syntax package::function() library(tidyverse) Data Wrangling Most of the raw data we work with starts off as what the computer considers messy. Perhaps there are some observations with incomplete data (columns are missing data) or there are multiple observations stored in each row (imagine a table with countries in the rows and a column for life expectancy in 1990 in one column and life expectancy in 2010 in the adjacent column). Data wrangling is the process of data cleaning and reshaping the raw data into a more usable form. This can be a lengthy process, and can often not feel as rewarding as generating statistical analysis or beautiful plots. But this is the foundation of your analysis so it is worth the investment! Data wrangling can also be an intimidating task because there is no straight forward formula to follow. How you clean up your data depends on what you’re starting with, what research question you are trying to address, and which packages you’re using in your analysis. In this section, we are going to get comfortable subseting the data and re-shaping dataframes.

Keep in mind that tidyverse creates their own rules for R and their functions work well with their own functions, but may not translate to work well with other packages build by different developers. For example, the core developer strongly believes that rownames are not useful and all the information should be stored in columns within the table so converting your data frame to their object variation called tibbles will automatically remove rownames without warnings. Rather than using square brackets to subset columns, we can select the rows that we want select(abalone, Diameter, Length, Whole.weight) #Tidyverse selecting columns abalone$Diameter #base R select can also be used to exclude specific columns select(abalone, -Length, -Diameter) Select only works on columns. We can use a similar function to filter for the rows that we want # Filter indexes rows filter(abalone, Sex == &quot;I&quot;) # abalone[abalone$Sex == &quot;I&quot;, ] summary(filter(abalone, Sex == c(&quot;I&quot;))) Functions within the tidyverse universe do not require quotations around column names - this is unique to tidyverse packages and does not translate to other applications! Another unique aspect of tidyverse is that their commands can be chained together using the pipe %&gt;%. This cumbersome chain of characters can be inserted with the shortcut cnt/cmd + shift + M. Let’s recreate the same object of abalone_small first with intermediate objects Reminder of the object requirements: - Whole.weight under 1 - Columns Length, Diameter, and Whole.weight abalone_sub1 &lt;- filter(abalone, Whole.weight &lt; 1) abalone_sub2 &lt;- select(abalone_sub1, Length, Diameter, Whole.weight) summary(abalone_sub2) ## Length Diameter Whole.weight ## Min. :0.0750 Min. :0.055 Min. :0.0020 ## 1st Qu.:0.4000 1st Qu.:0.305 1st Qu.:0.3040 ## Median :0.4800 Median :0.375 Median :0.5420 ## Mean :0.4613 Mean :0.356 Mean :0.5358 ## 3rd Qu.:0.5400 3rd Qu.:0.420 3rd Qu.:0.7800 ## Max. :0.6350 Max. :0.510 Max. :0.9995 Now we’re going to combine this all together into one call abalone_sub3 &lt;- abalone %&gt;% filter(Whole.weight &lt; 1) %&gt;% select(Length, Diameter, Whole.weight) head(abalone_sub3) ## Length Diameter Whole.weight ## 1 0.455 0.365 0.5140 ## 2 0.350 0.265 0.2255 ## 3 0.530 0.420 0.6770 ## 4 0.440 0.365 0.5160 ## 5 0.330 0.255 0.2050 ## 6 0.425 0.300 0.3515 summary(abalone_sub3) ## Length Diameter Whole.weight ## Min. :0.0750 Min. :0.055 Min. :0.0020 ## 1st Qu.:0.4000 1st Qu.:0.305 1st Qu.:0.3040 ## Median :0.4800 Median :0.375 Median :0.5420 ## Mean :0.4613 Mean :0.356 Mean :0.5358 ## 3rd Qu.:0.5400 3rd Qu.:0.420 3rd Qu.:0.7800 ## Max. :0.6350 Max. :0.510 Max. :0.9995 The functions are the same but since we are piping the results of the previous line to the next command, you do not need to (and should not) specify the object as the first argument in the function. group_by() and summarize() functions can be used to get summary statistics without the need to create intermediate objects abalone_sub3 &lt;- abalone %&gt;% filter(Whole.weight &lt; 1) %&gt;% select(Length, Diameter, Whole.weight, Sex) %&gt;% group_by(Sex) %&gt;% summarize(my_own_function = median(Whole.weight)) abalone_sub3 ## # A tibble: 3 × 2 ## Sex my_own_function ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 F 0.707 ## 2 I 0.370 ## 3 M 0.694 Exercise Using the base abalone object and tidyverse functions, investigate whether the mean length of male or females (group_by) are longer of abalone with a Shucked.weight greater than 0.3 AND a Shell.weight less than 0.3 (filtering rows) .

We will start with base R plots. Before we get started, it is always good to take a peek at the data and remind ourselves of what we’re working with head(abalone) ## Sex Length Diameter Height Whole.weight Shucked.weight Viscera.weight ## 1 M 0.455 0.365 0.095 0.5140 0.2245 0.1010 ## 2 M 0.350 0.265 0.090 0.2255 0.0995 0.0485 ## 3 F 0.530 0.420 0.135 0.6770 0.2565 0.1415 ## 4 M 0.440 0.365 0.125 0.5160 0.2155 0.1140 ## 5 I 0.330 0.255 0.080 0.2050 0.0895 0.0395 ## 6 I 0.425 0.300 0.095 0.3515 0.1410 0.0775 ## Shell.weight Rings maturity Percent.weight ## 1 0.150 15 mature 1.496667 ## 2 0.070 7 mature 1.421429 ## 3 0.210 9 mature 1.221429 ## 4 0.155 10 mature 1.390323 ## 5 0.055 7 infant 1.627273 ## 6 0.120 8 infant 1.175000 Remember that the first column of abalone Sex was originally were character values but we wrangled this data into factors to recognize that there are relationships between observations with the same values (ie. all the abalone with a value “M” in the Sex column share the same biological Sex) Base R plots are great for taking a quick peek at your data plot(abalone$Length, abalone$Whole.weight) plot(abalone$Length, abalone$Whole.weight, col = abalone$Sex) Note You cannot color on a column of categorical data if it is not a factor because each entry is considered unique, there are no shared characteristics between the observations. It can be confusing to figure out which color corresponds to which category in base R. class(abalone$Sex) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; levels(abalone$Sex) ## [1] &quot;F&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;M&quot; Let’s make a table to specify the color we want each level to be plot(abalone$Length, abalone$Whole.weight, col=abalone$Sex, main = &quot;Abalone weight increases with length&quot;, xlab = &quot;Length (mm)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Whole weight (g)&quot;) legend(x=&quot;bottomright&quot;, legend = levels(abalone$Sex), col = 1:3, pch = 5 ) Base R plots use layers so the base plot() must be created first, before the legend() layer is added on top. I stands for infant so it makes sense that they would be smaller in weight and length compared to the mature abalone. Before we move on to the next type of plot, let’s customize it a bit more by cleaning up the axis Scatterplot with ggplot ggplot() was created to support customizable and reproducible plots. The way that the ggplot() function accepts the data is much different from the base R plot() function. The both columns of data must be in the same dataframe and specified in the data parameter. Then, the x and y axis must be specified using the aesthetic aes parameter. The base ggplot() call only holds the data, the geometry or format of the plot must be further specified by a separate call. While commas , separate the parameters in a function, plus signs + are used to specify different layers of the plot. This is the basic template for ggplots: ggplot(data = , mapping = aes()) + () library(ggplot2) A single continuous variable can be displayed using a histogram. ggplot(data = abalone, mapping = aes(x=Length)) + geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with ## `binwidth`. nrow(abalone) ## [1] 4177 Two continuous variables can be contrasted using a point or scatter plot. ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Length, y = Whole.weight)) + geom_point() It is a lot simpler to add color to ggplots ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Length, y = Whole.weight, col = Sex)) + geom_point() There’s a lot of dots that are piling up on top of each other so we can change the alpha value to modify the transparency. Remember, you can always look up more information about each function using the ? or looking online! No need to memorize everything! ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Length, y = Whole.weight, col = Sex)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3) Exercise Create a plot to investigate the relationship between the shucked weight and the shell weight of ONLY adult abalone (exclude the infant abalones). Color the plot by Sex, do you notice any difference between the two? abalone_MF &lt;- abalone[abalone$Sex %in% c(&quot;M&quot;, &quot;F&quot;), ] ggplot(abalone_MF, aes(x=Shucked.weight, y = Shell.weight, col = Sex)) + geom_point() Let’s take a closer look at categorical data. One categorical data can be displayed with a bar plot. This is helpful when we are looking to see if we have equal representation in each of the sample groups. ggplot(abalone, aes(x= Sex, fill = Sex)) + geom_bar() Bar plots can also be easily modified. ggplot(abalone, aes(x= Sex, fill = Sex)) + geom_bar(width = 0.5) + coord_flip() Lastly, boxplots are used to describe the relationship between a continuous and a categorical variable. ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Sex, y = Whole.weight)) + geom_boxplot() This more clearly shows that the weight distribution is comparable between the males and females. However, it would be clearer to have the F and M bars adjacent for comparison. levels(abalone$Sex) ## [1] &quot;F&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;M&quot; abalone$Sex &lt;- factor(abalone$Sex, levels = c(&quot;I&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;M&quot;)) ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Sex, y = Whole.weight)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic() Multi-panel Plots with ggplot Plots can be saved as objects p1 &lt;- ggplot(abalone_MF, aes(x=Shucked.weight, y = Shell.weight, col = Sex)) + geom_point() p2 &lt;- ggplot(abalone, aes(x = Sex, y = Whole.weight)) + geom_boxplot() + theme_classic() p1 Rather than flipping between separating plots and stitching them together afterwards in a photo editor, we can arrange them into a figure panel all together in R #install.packages(&quot;cowplot&quot;) library(cowplot) ## ## Attaching package: &#39;cowplot&#39; ## The following object is masked from &#39;package:lubridate&#39;: ## ## stamp plot_grid(p1, p2) Let’s clean this up a bit top_row &lt;- plot_grid(p1 + theme_classic(), p2, labels = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), label_size = 20) top_row Adding a third plot to play around with the distribution between panels We want p1 to be larger by itself in the top row and then p2 and p3 split in the bottom row. p3 &lt;- ggplot(abalone, aes(Sex)) + geom_bar() plot_grid(top_row, p3, ncol=1, labels = c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), label_size = 20) Exporting plots getwd() ## [1] &quot;/Users/clin/Documents/CBWGitHub/INR-2024&quot; png(file = &quot;INR_fig1.png&quot;, bg = &quot;transparent&quot;) top_row dev.off() ## quartz_off_screen ## 2 Day 1 Project For this mini guided project, we will be working with a dataset quantifying water quality that is publicly available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability?resource=download Here is some description of the data: Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions. Content The water_potability.csv file contains water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. More information about each of the columns can be found in the link above pH value Hardness Solids (Total dissolved solids - TDS) Chloramines Sulfate Conductivity Organic_carbon Trihalomethanes Turbidity Potability Insert a code chunk underneath each step to carry out the instruction. Read in the “water_potability.csv” data into an object called data Check the object you created by printing out the first 10 rows and applying the summary function. Notice that the pH column contains a couple hundred NA values. NA are special values in R (like how “pi” is preset to a value of 3.14159…) to indicate that there is missing data, or it is not available. There are also some NAs in the Sulfate and Trihalomethanes columns. Create new object called water_df that only contains complete observations. Tip Take a look at the function called na.omit(). In most cases, someone’s already done what you’ve wanted to do so there may already be code or functions that you can adapt and use! The Potability column has two possible values: 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable. It is read in by default as a character vector. Convert this column to a factor. WHO has recommended maximum permissible limit of pH in drinking water from 6.5 to 8.5. Create a new column within the water_df object called ph_category in which: Observations with a pH less than 6.5 have a value of acidic in the ph_category Observations with a pH betwee 6.5 - 8.5 have a value of permissible in the ph_category Observations with a pH greater than 8.5 have a value of basic in the ph_category There are multiple ways to do this, give it a go! You can’t break the object - if you ever feel like you need a reset, you can always repeat step 1 to read in the object again. Use table() or summary() to check the values in the ph_category column Create a plot to double check if the annotations in the ph_category column were applied correctly. Make sure to represent both the ph and ph_category columns. You’re welcome to use base R or ggplot functions. There are multiple ways of representing these two columns. ggplot is slightly preferred because of its increased customization so it’s good to get some practice with it! The levels of sulfates and water hardness cause by salts should be minimized in order to be safe for consumption. Create a plot with the level of water hardness on the x axis and sulphate on the y axis colored by the Potability column. Try applying the facet_grid() layer to the plot in order to group the plots by a factor. Make sure to use the ~ before the column name! Note The data is quite messy so don’t worry if the results do not separate as much as you would like - real data is messy! Lab Completed! Congratulations! You have completed Lab 1!

Make sure to represent both the ph and ph_category columns. You’re welcome to use base R or ggplot functions. There are multiple ways of representing these two columns. ggplot is slightly preferred because of its increased customization so it’s good to get some practice with it! library(ggplot2) ggplot(water_df, aes(x=ph_category, y=ph)) + geom_boxplot() The levels of sulfates and water hardness cause by salts should be minimized in order to be safe for consumption. Create a plot with the level of water hardness on the x axis and sulphate on the y axis colored by the Potability column. Try applying the facet_grid() layer to the plot in order to group the plots by a factor. Make sure to use the ~ before the column name! Note The data is quite messy so don’t worry if the results do not separate as much as you would like - real data is messy! ggplot(water_df, aes(x = Hardness, y = Sulfate, col = Potability)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ph_category) + theme_bw() Review with Datasaurus Dozen The Datasaurus Dozen dataset is a handful of data points that complement the dplyr package.

Let’s take a look the data graphically. We will use filter to extract the rows belonging to one dataset and then pipe that directly into a ggplot. Both dplyr and ggplot are developed within “the Tidyverse” and can use pipes, but you may not be able to pipe in base R functions or functions from different packages. datasaurus_dozen %&gt;% filter(dataset == &quot;star&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) + # PLUS SIGN, NOT PIPE FOR THIS ONE geom_point() Tidyverse’s data wranging packages use the pipe %&gt;% to move the previous output to the next line, where as ggplot uses the plus sign + Try editing the code above to display different datasets. Notice how different groups of data points can all give similar statistical summaries - so it’s always a good choice to visualize your data rather than relying on just numbers. If we wanted to take a look at all of the datasets at once, we can also use the facet_wrap() function. datasaurus_dozen %&gt;% #filter(dataset == &quot;star&quot;) %&gt;% REMOVE THIS ROW ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~dataset)+ theme_void() # ADD THIS LINE head(datasaurus_dozen) ## # A tibble: 6 × 3 ## dataset x y ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 dino 55.4 97.2 ## 2 dino 51.5 96.0 ## 3 dino 46.2 94.5 ## 4 dino 42.8 91.4 ## 5 dino 40.8 88.3 ## 6 dino 38.7 84.9 Generalizable Code A major strength of programming is the ability to automate repetitive tasks. As a general rule of thumb, if you need to do a task more than three times (ex. analyzing multiple PCR plates or integrating clinical data from multiple days), it is worth it to invest time to write generalizable code or a custom function. Now that we’re getting comfortable writing code, we will spend some time revisiting code that we wrote to make them generalizable and even better! Generalizable means that the code is flexible and can be applied to multiple similar objects. For example, if we’re running a clinical study and we have patient demographic data from multiple sites, we want to check that the mean patient demographic is comparable between sites by creating similar plots of each hospital site to compare. If we write code for one location and then copy and paste it into another code chunk to apply to the next location, the code may require some modification before it works. Generalizable code begins at data collection. Depending on your workflow, you may or may not be able to influence this stage of the analysis. If possible, it is best practice to keep the column names and entries for categorical variables consistent. For example, when recording the age of patients, “6”, “6”, “six”, and “Six” are all considered different levels of the factor so you will need to either make sure data collection is consistent or check and correct these inconsistencies in your code. Get into a habit of checking your work. Whether it is code you’ve written yourself, code you you’ve been sent by a collaborator, or published data from a biobank - never assume the data is as you predicted. Generalizable Plots Remember when we edited our code to test out multiple datasets in the datasaurus dozen object? Perhaps you copy and pasted the code several time and changed the column name? This is not optimal because if you need to change the code in one instance (for example changing the x-axis label), you’ll need to revisit ever instance that you copy and pasted to code to. This approach leads you vulnerable to errors when copy and pasting. One way to make your code robust is to bring all the factors that need editing to the start of the data. This may seem cumbersome for such a simple example where we are only changing the dataset name, but we’ll return to this concept later with more complicated examples. Let’s grab the code we used to make one plot earlier and modify it to be more generalizable levels(datasaurus_dozen$dataset) ## [1] &quot;away&quot; &quot;bullseye&quot; &quot;circle&quot; &quot;dino&quot; &quot;dots&quot; ## [6] &quot;h_lines&quot; &quot;high_lines&quot; &quot;slant_down&quot; &quot;slant_up&quot; &quot;star&quot; ## [11] &quot;v_lines&quot; &quot;wide_lines&quot; &quot;x_shape&quot; dataset_name &lt;- &quot;dino&quot; # ADD THIS LINE datasaurus_dozen %&gt;% filter(dataset == dataset_name) %&gt;% # Remove comment # CHANGE VARIABLE NAME ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() # REMOVE THE + at the end of the line Once we have converted our code to a generalized format, we can convert it into a more versatile custom function! Curly brackets are used for inputting multiple lines of code. It is generally attached to the function that proceeds it. # dataset_name &lt;- &quot;dino&quot; # ADD THIS LINE dino_plot &lt;- function(data_name) { datasaurus_dozen %&gt;% filter(dataset == data_name) %&gt;% # CHANGE ARGUMENT NAME ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() } dino_plot(&quot;dino&quot;) dino_plot(&quot;circle&quot;) Exercise We’ve now encountered round brackets (), square brackets [], and curly brackets{} - each have their own distinct functions! Take a few moments to chat with your neighbors and outline cases in which we’ve used each bracket and what is their role in R syntax. round brackets () come after a function, function will apply to whatever is in the brackets functionName(what is being acted on) square brackets [] Indexing, locations object[position] dataframe[rows, cols] curly brackets {} Used in function, indicate multiple lines of related code Rmd – indicates language in code chunk Dataset - Heart Stroke Prediction The dataset we will be working with for today’s workshop contains clinical data collected with the aim of predicting whether a patient is likely to suffer a stroke. The dataset can be found: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset Here is some more information about the columns in this dataset: id: unique identifier gender: “Male”, “Female” or “Other” age: age of the patient hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn’t have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn’t have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease ever_married: “No” or “Yes” work_type: “children”, “Govt_jov”, “Never_worked”, “Private” or “Self-employed” Residence_type: “Rural” or “Urban” avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood bmi: body mass index smoking_status: “formerly smoked”, “never smoked”, “smokes” or “Unknown”* stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not Note “Unknown” in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient Let’s get started! Exercise Reading in the dataset can be an intimidating step when you’re just starting out with programming. Since this is a csv file, we can use the appropriately named read.csv() function. In cases when you have other file types such as .txt or .tab files that are tab deliminated, there is also a read.table() function that is more universal (but requires more parameters to let R know how your data is stored). Read in the healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv into an object called heart. Check your object using head and/or summary functions. Toggle a parameter called stringsAsFactors to TRUE in order to automatically import character values as factors rather than characters Tip Make sure the dataset is in the same directory or folder as this .Rmd file for ease of import heart &lt;- read.csv(&quot;../INR-2024/datasets/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors=TRUE) head(heart) ## id gender age hypertension heart_disease ever_married work_type ## 1 9046 Male 67 0 1 Yes Private ## 2 51676 Female 61 0 0 Yes Self-employed ## 3 31112 Male 80 0 1 Yes Private ## 4 60182 Female 49 0 0 Yes Private ## 5 1665 Female 79 1 0 Yes Self-employed ## 6 56669 Male 81 0 0 Yes Private ## Residence_type avg_glucose_level bmi smoking_status stroke ## 1 Urban 228.69 36.6 formerly smoked 1 ## 2 Rural 202.21 N/A never smoked 1 ## 3 Rural 105.92 32.5 never smoked 1 ## 4 Urban 171.23 34.4 smokes 1 ## 5 Rural 174.12 24 never smoked 1 ## 6 Urban 186.21 29 formerly smoked 1 str(heart) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 5110 obs. of 12 variables: ## $ id : int 9046 51676 31112 60182 1665 56669 53882 10434 27419 60491 ... ## $ gender : Factor w/ 6 levels &quot;female&quot;,&quot;Female&quot;,..: 4 2 4 2 2 4 4 2 2 2 ... ## $ age : num 67 61 80 49 79 81 74 69 59 78 ... ## $ hypertension : Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;0&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;10&quot;,&quot;10+D4972&quot;: 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 ... ## $ heart_disease : int 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ... ## $ ever_married : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ work_type : Factor w/ 8 levels &quot;children&quot;,&quot;Govt_job&quot;,..: 5 7 5 5 7 5 5 5 5 5 ... ## $ Residence_type : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Rural&quot;,&quot;Urban&quot;: 2 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ... ## $ avg_glucose_level: num 229 202 106 171 174 ... ## $ bmi : Factor w/ 419 levels &quot;10.3&quot;,&quot;11.3&quot;,..: 240 419 199 218 114 164 148 102 419 116 ... ## $ smoking_status : Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;formerly smoked&quot;,..: 1 2 2 3 2 1 2 2 4 4 ... ## $ stroke : int 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... # Hypertension has values that are typos, need to be removed table(heart$hypertension) ## ## 0 1 10 10+D4972 ## 4612 493 4 1 # Stroke and heart.disease need to be categorical summary(heart$stroke) ## Min. 1st Qu.

Before we dive into this dataset, we get a very limited indication that the object is read in correctly by checking the Environment panel - you’ll notice the new heart appears under Data and it lets us know that there are 5110 observations (number of patients) and 12 variables (number of clinical features with entries). You can also double click the name of the object here to open up a view of the whole dataset - caution that this can cause your machine to stall if the dataset is exceptionally large and/or your machine is running on minimal memory. Exercise Explore the dataset! Take a look at the columns and identify some potential issues with this dataset that either warrant further investigation or correction. There is no universally right or wrong way to do this. Perhaps the only truly incorrect way of doing this is going through the dataset which is thousands of observations line by line. Factors The stringsAsFactors parameter takes care of the character values but we still have some integer values that should be interpreted as factors. When deciding on whether a number is a factor or should be kept numeric, consider if decimals/numbers-in-between make sense. The first two entries for avg_glucose_level are 229 and 202 - a glucose level in between would be reasonable. In contrast, the first to entries for heart_disease are 1 and 0 - as these are coding for having or not having the disorder, an entry of 1.2 does not make sense. Recall from the introduction to the dataset from above: 4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn’t have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension 5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn’t have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease 12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not heart$hypertension &lt;- as.factor(heart$hypertension) heart$heart_disease &lt;- as.factor(heart$heart_disease) heart$stroke &lt;- as.factor(heart$stroke) summary(heart) ## id gender age hypertension heart_disease ## Min. : 67 female: 7 Min. : 0.08 0 :4612 0:4834 ## 1st Qu.:17741 Female:2987 1st Qu.:25.00 1 : 493 1: 276 ## Median :36932 male : 6 Median :45.00 10 : 4 ## Mean :36518 Male :2108 Mean :43.23 10+D4972: 1 ## 3rd Qu.:54682 meal : 1 3rd Qu.:61.00 ## Max. :72940 Other : 1 Max. :82.00 ## ## ever_married work_type Residence_type avg_glucose_level ## No :1757 Private :2921 Rural:2514 Min. : 55.12 ## Yes:3353 Self-employed: 818 Urban:2596 1st Qu.: 77.25 ## children : 687 Median : 91.89 ## Govt_job : 656 Mean :106.15 ## Never_worked : 22 3rd Qu.:114.09 ## Private : 4 Max. :271.74 ## (Other) : 2 ## bmi smoking_status stroke ## N/A : 201 formerly smoked: 885 0:4861 ## 28.7 : 41 never smoked :1892 1: 249 ## 28.4 : 38 smokes : 789 ## 26.1 : 37 Unknown :1544 ## 26.7 : 37 ## 27.6 : 37 ## (Other):4719 Incomplete Data Firstly, we have to make a decision on how to handle missing values. We can either accept that some of the columns are incomplete or eliminate rows that do not have full data. Let’s evaluate which columns this affects If you ever encounter missing data when you are entering data, use NA. ggplot(heart, aes(x = smoking_status, fill = hypertension)) + geom_bar() prop.table(table(heart$smoking_status, heart$hypertension)) ## ## 0 1 10 10+D4972 ## formerly smoked 0.1497064579 0.0232876712 0.0001956947 0.0000000000 ## never smoked 0.3248532290 0.0448140900 0.0003913894 0.0001956947 ## smokes 0.1360078278 0.0183953033 0.0000000000 0.0000000000 ## Unknown 0.2919765166 0.0099804305 0.0001956947 0.0000000000 Let’s use tidyverse to remove the rows in the smoking_status column with a value of Unknown. dim(heart) # original 5110 rows ## [1] 5110 12 table(heart$smoking_status) #1544 unknowns ## ## formerly smoked never smoked smokes Unknown ## 885 1892 789 1544 dim(filter(heart, !(smoking_status == &quot;Unknown&quot;))) ## [1] 3566 12 heart &lt;- filter(heart, !(smoking_status == &quot;Unknown&quot;)) summary(heart$smoking_status) ## formerly smoked never smoked smokes Unknown ## 885 1892 789 0 After double checking, we can see that the smoking status has an empty level, we’ll clean this up before moving on heart$smoking_status &lt;- droplevels(heart$smoking_status) summary(heart$smoking_status) ## formerly smoked never smoked smokes ## 885 1892 789 heart_checkpoint &lt;- heart Great! Now let’s tackle the typos in the gender column. table(heart$gender) ## ## female Female male Male meal Other ## 5 2153 5 1402 0 1 We need to fix the typos that happened during data entry and the single observation of Other will not be enough data for us to draw any statistical conclusion so we’ll remove this row while we’re at it. We can use str_replace_all() as a search and replace tool table(str_replace_all(heart$gender, &quot;female&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;)) ## ## Female male Male Other ## 2158 5 1402 1 # str_replace_all(data, what we&#39;re search, what to replace with) Remember that this only displays the output, it does not replace the columns in the dataset.

Good thing we made a checkpoint earlier. Let’s bring this back to our main heart object - it’s a good habit to make some objects to checkpoint your work. In case you have not had this set up, you can always back track in your code and re-read in the object and re-run some earlier code to catch up. heart &lt;- heart_checkpoint table(heart$gender) ## ## female Female male Male meal Other ## 5 2153 5 1402 0 1 Let’s try this again: # From previous code # add ^ (carrot) to the start of the search term to make sure it&#39;s only found at the start of the word heart$gender &lt;- str_replace_all(heart$gender, c(&quot;^female&quot; = &quot;Female&quot;, &quot;^male&quot; = &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;^meal&quot; = &quot;Male&quot;)) heart$gender[wrong_entry] ## [1] &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Female&quot; &quot;Female&quot; table(heart$gender) ## ## Female Male Other ## 2158 1407 1 The ^ is a special character that indicates the start of a word. Lastly, we’ll the one Other entry heart &lt;- heart[!heart$gender == &quot;Other&quot;, ] # object[rows, col] table(heart$gender) ## ## Female Male ## 2158 1407 Overall, the data is looking much cleaner than when we started!

It will cycle through a range of inputs and “for” each of them, it will carry out your custom task. Here’s a very simple example to show you the structure of for loops fruits &lt;- c(&quot;strawberry&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;) for(x in fruits) { print(x) } ## [1] &quot;strawberry&quot; ## [1] &quot;banana&quot; ## [1] &quot;orange&quot; The for() function accepts firstly the name of a temporary object that exists only within the curly brackets of the for loop, the in is a special R syntax specification, and fruit is the object that we are applying the for loop on. The for loop will take each entry of the fruits object, store it in the temporary object x, and apply the code written written within the curly bracket before repeating with the next entry. I recommend testing your code outside the for() loop before moving it into the loop to make sure it is robust and if you are applying the loop to a long vector or large dataset, consider trying it on a truncated version first as a proof of principle. levels(heart$smoking_status) ## [1] &quot;formerly smoked&quot; &quot;never smoked&quot; &quot;smokes&quot; heart %&gt;% filter(smoking_status == &quot;never smoked&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=avg_glucose_level, y=bmi)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(&quot;never smoked&quot;) + theme_classic() If we wanted to save a pdf of every category of smoking_status, we can convert our code into a loop. When working on a larger section of code, it is helpful to sketch out the steps you need to do with # comments to keep you focused. smoke_cat &lt;- levels(heart$smoking_status) smoke_cat ## [1] &quot;formerly smoked&quot; &quot;never smoked&quot; &quot;smokes&quot; getwd() # get working directory ## [1] &quot;/Users/clin/Documents/CBWGitHub/INR-2024&quot; for(cat in smoke_cat) { # Specify file name filename_cat &lt;- paste0(&quot;bmi_glucose_&quot;, cat, &quot;.png&quot;) print(filename_cat) # Making plot (based on code from above) plot_cat &lt;- heart %&gt;% # SAVE OUTPUT TO OBJECT filter(smoking_status == cat) %&gt;% # CHANGE TO cat ggplot(aes(x=avg_glucose_level, y=bmi)) + geom_point() + ggtitle(cat) + # CHANGE TO cat theme_classic() #print(plot_cat) # PRINT OUT PLOT # Saving the plot to file png(filename_cat, width = 700, height= 500, res=120) # Start saving whatever I make now to this file print(plot_cat) dev.off() # Stop saving } ## [1] &quot;bmi_glucose_formerly smoked.png&quot; ## [1] &quot;bmi_glucose_never smoked.png&quot; ## [1] &quot;bmi_glucose_smokes.png&quot; Exercise Copy and paste the loop from above and modify it so that the range of values on the x and y axis are the same for all plots. Tip The limits of the x axis can be specified by adding a layer called xlim(lower, upper) where it takes two numbers - the lower limit followed by the upper limit. These numbers can be stored in objects or inputted directly . Similarly, there is a parallel function called ylim() which also takes the same two parameters When working through the code, you can temporarily remove the code removing the axis labels by commenting out the lines with a hashtag. Great! Now the y-axis does not change between the plots and they are directly comparable. Conditional for Loops Boolean statements can be used to write conditional statements. If we do not want the loop to be applied to every item, we can add a condition. food &lt;- &quot;pineapple&quot; if(food == &quot;pineapple&quot;) { print(&quot;This indeed is a pineapple.&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;This indeed is a pineapple.&quot; This will only output if the condition is met. We can also modify this statement to do something in case the condition is not met. food &lt;- &quot;orange&quot; if(food == &quot;pineapple&quot;) { print(&quot;This indeed is a pineapple.&quot;) } else { print(&quot;This is NOT a pineapple.&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;This is NOT a pineapple.&quot; Using if else statements will allow more customizability in our code. Let’s use this to add a new column called ever_smoked based on the value in the smoking_status column. table(heart$stroke) ## ## 0 1 ## 3363 202 heart$stroke_history &lt;- NA head(heart) ## id gender age hypertension heart_disease ever_married work_type ## 1 9046 Male 67 0 1 Yes Private ## 2 51676 Female 61 0 0 Yes Self-employed ## 3 31112 Male 80 0 1 Yes Private ## 4 60182 Female 49 0 0 Yes Private ## 5 1665 Female 79 1 0 Yes Self-employed ## 6 56669 Male 81 0 0 Yes Private ## Residence_type avg_glucose_level bmi smoking_status stroke stroke_history ## 1 Urban 228.69 240 formerly smoked 1 NA ## 2 Rural 202.21 419 never smoked 1 NA ## 3 Rural 105.92 199 never smoked 1 NA ## 4 Urban 171.23 218 smokes 1 NA ## 5 Rural 174.12 114 never smoked 1 NA ## 6 Urban 186.21 164 formerly smoked 1 NA for(row in 1:nrow(heart)) { if(heart$stroke[row] == &quot;1&quot;) { heart$stroke_history[row] &lt;- &quot;confirmed_stroke&quot; } else { heart$stroke_history[row] &lt;- &quot;no_history&quot; } # else &gt;&gt; &quot;no_history&quot; } table(heart$stroke, heart$stroke_history) ## ## confirmed_stroke no_history ## 0 0 3363 ## 1 202 0 Exercise Expected fasting blood glucose concentrations defined by the WHO are between 70 - 100 mg/dL.

Confirming that the variable is normally distributed opens up options for robust statistical approaches to be applied. Is this heart dataset normally distributed? QQ plots, or quantile-quantile plots, are unique scatterplots that help us determine the distribution. Rather than black and white diagnostic tool, this is a visualization tool for inform our analysis. The qqnorm() sorts the values in the vector and compares it to a theoretical normal distribution (the norm part of qqnorm). qqnorm(heart$bmi) For a normal distribution, we ideally want a straight diagonal line. Notice the slight curve on the right end, we can see the tail is also on the right side of this histogram. Curves indicate deviation away from normality. This looks faily normal, we can check to see if a transformation improves the distribution. ggplot(heart, aes(x = log2(bmi))) + geom_histogram() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with ## `binwidth`. qqnorm(log2(heart$bmi)) The tail is exaggerated. Since all transformations add some artificial noise, we avoid applying them when it does not significantly improve the shape of our data. We will proceed with the non-transformed data. Linear Models Linear regression models allow us to investigate the relationship between two continuous variables. For simple linear models, we have one independent and one dependent variable. The independent variable is the one that is being controlled or manipulated in the experiment, and the dependent variable will change respectively. For example, if we are investigating if a high fat diet affects sleep quality, the diet is the independent variable (changing or is different between participants) while the sleep quality is the dependent variable (depending on the diet, the sleep quality will change). Here, we are investigating the relation between bmi and avg_glucose_level We’ll first visualize the two variables ggplot(heart)+ geom_point(aes(x=bmi, y=avg_glucose_level, alpha=0.3)) Notice here the aes is specified in the geom_point() call rather than the parent ggplot() call. This is helpful if your plots have multiple layers and you want the aes to apply only to one layer. Parameters in the ggplot() call will apply to all layers in the plot where as parameters specified in the geom_point() will only affect this specific layer. For this plot with only one layer, this has no functional impact on the plot made, but this will be important if you make more complex and layered plots. fit &lt;- lm(avg_glucose_level ~ bmi, data = heart) This can be read as avg_glucose_level as a function of bmi Use the function summary() on fit1 object to obtain more details of the model. summary ## function (object, ...) ## UseMethod(&quot;summary&quot;) ## &lt;bytecode: 0x121d27368&gt; ## &lt;environment: namespace:base&gt; This overall looks like a good model. The p-value is very low and statistically significant. However, the Multiple R-squared values is small and the slope of bmi is low. From the results, we could conclude that changes in bmi are associated to the average glucose level as the p-value is less than 0.05. We can also state that as bmi increases, there will be an increase in the average glucose level as the slope is weakly positive 0.11. Now that our model has given us the intercept and slope, we can use this information to build a formula in the format of dependent = (m)(independent) + b avg_glucose_level = (0.097800)(bmi) + 90.823324 We can use our knowledge of writing functions to calculate the predict the glucose level from the patient’s bmi calc_gluc &lt;- function(bmi_value) { (0.097800*bmi_value) + 90.823324 # Change from brackets to * for multiply, bmi to bmi_value } heart[3, c(&quot;bmi&quot;, &quot;avg_glucose_level&quot;)] ## bmi avg_glucose_level ## 3 199 105.92 calc_gluc(119) ## [1] 102.4615 Next, let’s visualize this using ggplot # Start with code from previous point plot ggplot(heart, aes(x=bmi, y=avg_glucose_level, alpha=0.3, col = stroke))+ geom_point() + # ADD PLUS SIGN geom_abline(intercept = 90.823324, slope = 0.097800, color = &quot;purple&quot;) # ADD THIS LINE Exercise Hmm, this looks like there are two densities of data in this image. Let’s try to investigate if we can figure it out. I’ve started you off by creating two new objects, an object called heart_stroke that contains only patents who experienced a stroke (stroke == 1) and a second object called heart_nostroke that contains only patents who have not experienced a stroke (stroke == 0). Next, create two separate linear models called fit_stroke and fit_nostroke - are they different? How will you visualize the data? heart_stroke &lt;- filter(heart, stroke == 1) table(heart_stroke$stroke) ## ## 0 1 ## 0 202 heart_nostroke &lt;- filter(heart, stroke == 0) table(heart_nostroke$stroke) ## ## 0 1 ## 3363 0 # From above: # fit &lt;- lm(avg_glucose_level ~ bmi, data = heart) fit_stroke &lt;- lm(avg_glucose_level ~ bmi, data = heart_stroke) fit_nostroke &lt;- lm(avg_glucose_level ~ bmi, data = heart_nostroke) summary(fit_stroke) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = avg_glucose_level ~ bmi, data = heart_stroke) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -92.34 -51.38 -27.21 60.90 138.98 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Create a boxplot using ggplot with the cut on the x axis and the price on the y axis. ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) + geom_boxplot() Using the code in the previous step as foundation, create an object called diamonds_categorical that contains the name of all the categorical columns. Then, write a loop to print out a separate plot with each of the different categorical variables on the x axis and price on the y-axis. Tip Remember how aes can be specified in both the ggplot() or geom_xx() layer? You will need to use this because we are string the name of a column as a variable in our loop and in order for R to know that it is looking for a column name rather than an object, you will need to use the aes_string() parameter for just the geom_boxplot() layer to specify the changing x axis. The y axis can remain with aes() in the parent ggplot() layer. str(diamonds) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 53940 obs. of 11 variables: ## $ X : int 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ carat : num 0.23 0.21 0.23 0.29 0.31 0.24 0.24 0.26 0.22 0.23 ... ## $ cut : Factor w/ 5 levels &quot;Fair&quot;,&quot;Good&quot;,..: 3 4 2 4 2 5 5 5 1 5 ... ## $ color : Factor w/ 7 levels &quot;D&quot;,&quot;E&quot;,&quot;F&quot;,&quot;G&quot;,..: 2 2 2 6 7 7 6 5 2 5 ... ## $ clarity: Factor w/ 8 levels &quot;I1&quot;,&quot;IF&quot;,&quot;SI1&quot;,..: 4 3 5 6 4 8 7 3 6 5 ... ## $ depth : num 61.5 59.8 56.9 62.4 63.3 62.8 62.3 61.9 65.1 59.4 ... ## $ table : num 55 61 65 58 58 57 57 55 61 61 ... ## $ price : int 326 326 327 334 335 336 336 337 337 338 ... ## $ x : num 3.95 3.89 4.05 4.2 4.34 3.94 3.95 4.07 3.87 4 ... ## $ y : num 3.98 3.84 4.07 4.23 4.35 3.96 3.98 4.11 3.78 4.05 ... ## $ z : num 2.43 2.31 2.31 2.63 2.75 2.48 2.47 2.53 2.49 2.39 ... diamonds_categorical &lt;- c(&quot;cut&quot;, &quot;color&quot;, &quot;clarity&quot;) for(cat in diamonds_categorical) { diaplot &lt;- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(y = price)) + geom_boxplot(aes_string(x = cat)) print(diaplot) } ## Warning: `aes_string()` was deprecated in ggplot2 3.0.0. ## ℹ Please use tidy evaluation idioms with `aes()`. ## ℹ See also `vignette(&quot;ggplot2-in-packages&quot;)` for more ## information. ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this ## warning was generated. Write a function called diamond_continous that allows you to make a scatterplot that accepts one variable to plot on the x-axis as well as another variable to color the plot by as the inputs.
